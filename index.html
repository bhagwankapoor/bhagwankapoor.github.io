    <p> Rich in ethnic motifs and colors, the visual vocabulary of Indian American artists continue to be shaped by the country of their origin. Bhagwan Kapoor is one of the most prominent contemporary Indian artists who are playing a major role in taking their art to the public internationally. Bhagwan Kapoor has carved a special niche for himself in from the frenetic art world of New York.</p>
    <p> Like several other Indian American artists including Bhavsar, Krishna Reddy, Mohan Samant, F.N. Souza, and Vijay Kumar who are flourishing in the crowded world of contemporary art in the U.S., Bhagwan Kapoor too deserves a special mention for taking their contemporary Indian art to the public internationally. This prolific painter has established himself as one of the most important and significant ones of his generation. Bhagwan Kapoor completed his Diploma in Painting from Sir JJ School of Art, Mumbai. Since then he has held several solo shows apart from participating in many group shows in India and internationally. Among the awards he won are 'Usha Deshmukh Gold Medal' and an award at the All India Annual Art Exhibition in Hyderabad. The works of Bhagwan Kapoor, who has studied at the Ecole des Beaux Arts and Atelier 17 in Paris, find a lace in various prestigious private collections and have been published by UNICEF and Reader's Digest.</p>
    <p> Bhagwan Kapoor is based in New York.</p>
